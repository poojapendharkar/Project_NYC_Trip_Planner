# Project_NYC_Trip_Planner
Data Wrangling Process replicable for other urban areas

To Replicate the project for another city say X:
1. Start with the Raw Datasets - extract data from various sources for tourist attractions in city X
2. Extract zipcode proximity data for major tourist attractions 
3. Use python code files in folder (2. Python Code Files (Data Wrangling Steps) to wrangle the data 
  a. Please note the steps might vary as per the dataset
  b. The steps to extract zipcode from address is given in code file (Water_trail)
  c. For each dataset make sure to take a csv file as an output for the next step
4. Clean datasets are used in final code
5. Final code file is used to merge all clean datasets and then filter out data as per distance, type of tourist and major tourist attraction
